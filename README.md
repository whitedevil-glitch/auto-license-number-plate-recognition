The installation depends on your operating system. I am using this program on Windows.

We should add a PATH to windows system variables. Actually it’s an easy step. First we need to find and copy the root folder of the tesseract installation. That should be looking like this:

``` C:\Program Files\Tesseract-OCR ```

And then in the search bar of the windows Advanced System Settings

### Advanced system settings > Advanced > Environment variables > PATH > New

Paste the source path which copied and save this configurations. After this step the computer must be rebooted to apply configurations.

The tesseract installation completed. You can confirm the installation from the command line. When we run ``` tesseract ``` command on the command line, it should give us information about the program.

### Now You can run the program.
